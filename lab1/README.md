# Lab 1
The purpose of the lab is to create a buffer that is free of memory leakage by using the Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII) idiom.
The 'int_buffer' class is the buffer container to hold integers. The 'int_sorted' class makes sure the buffer is always sorted by using merge sort.
A comparison between selection sort, the standard sort function in c++ and merge sort is made.
