# Lab 2
Purpose of the lab is to create a class hierarchy with shapes. The class Shape is the abstract base class that all the other classes inherit from. Every subclass derive the data member color and the pure virtual function get_area() from the base class. Every class has its own implementation on how to calculate the area of the shape.
